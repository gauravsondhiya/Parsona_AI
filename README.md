what if Mirzapur had its own AI chatbot?

Right now, I’m learning Generative AI (GenAI). I’ve already covered most of the topics, and now I’m starting to build real-world projects by integrating GenAI.

My first project is a Mirzapur Persona-based chatbot.

In simple words, Persona Prompting means training an AI to reply like a specific character or person. You feed the AI with how that character talks — their tone, style, choice of words, and sentence patterns. So when you chat with them, it feels like you’re really talking to that character.

For this project, I created chatbots for three characters from the Mirzapur series. When you chat with them, each one replies in their own style, just like in the show.

Use cases:
- It can be used in customer service apps, making support more personalized and engaging.On your product website, you can train a chatbot with your product’s data so that customers get the exact answers they need.


💀In Version 2 Improvements (Coming Soon):
- Train the LLM with more data to make replies even more realistic.
- Filter out abusive or violent words to keep the chatbot safe and user-friendly.
- Integrate Persona Voices so that each character not only types but also speaks in their own style.
